# Twitter sentiment analysis

In this project, I attempt to use a Naive Bayes Classifier to extract sentiment analysis from tweets captured on twitter on Oct. 27th of 2019 for the keyword "Baghdadi". The tweets are from the day after the United States President Donald Trump confirms death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 

This topic is especially interesting because Trump went further than just announcing the raidâ€™s success. He answered questions after his dramatic remarks, divulging an astonishing amount about US intelligence and American military operations that could benefit American adversaries in the future.
